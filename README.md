hello

f1 and f2 save and load. IMPORTANT!! this is kinda broken rn but make sure to save ONLY during morning and no other times. but, also dont load in the same day it resets the shop (unless you want to do that i guess)

e interacts with most things. there are two phases: shop and survive. right now, survive is pretty barebones but you can explore the museum while spooky guys follow you. shopping is in the morning and should be mostly functional, you buy artifacts and place them on the ground
right now only the area in front of your office has space to place artifacts, but it will be everywhere soon.
you have 5 minutes before night, or you can turn it to night automatically at the clock. please ignore the desk right now its not finished. in the room behind where you spawned is your bed, sleep there to go to the next day in the night time. your fees will compound, 
increasing by 1000 every morning. the monster is kinda borked rn but whatever. sleeping heals you also, and restores your stamina.
you have limited oil in your lantern, you can refill outside of your room. first update will have "ojectives" you need to go to before you can sleep to promote wellness and health of your legs.
f4 closes the game and esc pauses, there is no menu at the moment and also only one resolution.
crtl to crouch, 1 does damage to you. enjoy yourself exploring the Museum!!!

for cheats, v noclips and g and b go up and down. Never press N.
